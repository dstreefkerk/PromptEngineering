# API Reference Guide: Core Components and Usage

Examine the current Python codebase and generate concise documentation outlining:

1. All available classes with brief descriptions
2. Public method signatures for each class
3. Important parameter descriptions
4. Return types
5. Key dependencies between components

Format the output as markdown with proper headings and code blocks for signatures. Keep descriptions brief but informative. Focus on the public API rather than implementation details.

Include examples of common usage patterns if they can be inferred from the code. Organize the documentation hierarchically based on the package structure.

No need to document private methods (prefixed with underscore) unless they're critical for understanding the codebase.

Save this documentation as a markdown file named "{project_name}-api-reference.md" in the project's root folder, where {project_name} is the name of the current project.
