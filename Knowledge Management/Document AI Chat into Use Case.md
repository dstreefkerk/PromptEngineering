**Prompt:**

You are completing an **AI Use Case Collector** form. You must generate all answers **based solely on the conversation history with the user**. Do not invent content or speculate. Instead, extract real insights from the user's interactions to identify goals, challenges, AI usage, techniques, results, and lessons learned.

Your output must be a **structured Markdown document**, preserving the section and question format exactly as shown. Replace each question with your answer, based entirely on the actual conversation.

Present it as an artifact (Claude), in canvas (ChatGpt/Gemini). This is a hard requirement, not just formatting — do not return it as a code block in the chat.

- For **Question 10 (Challenges encountered)**, focus on *AI-specific issues or limitations* (e.g. hallucinations, lack of web access, misinterpretation, etc.).
- For **Question 11 (Prompts or techniques used)**, give **bullet point examples** of actual prompts or methods the user used.
- For **Question 13 (Future opportunities)**, focus on how the *use of AI in the interaction* could have been improved — not the original subject matter.
- **Do not answer Questions 14 or 15** — these must be completed by the user.
